# LogisticClassifierImpl
A test project to get familliar with the Logistic classifier algorithm. Uses the WEKA library to perfrom the classification.

This project tackles the classic iris classification problem.
A very straightforward implementation to get familliar with the the WEKA library.

The data is split into a training and a test set. After loading and preparing the data it is passed to the logistic classifier for training.
After that it will be evaulated based on it's ability to classify the test data.
